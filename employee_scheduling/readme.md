## Employee Preference Table

Please fill out the employee preference table with your own "preference" scheme. An example of such scheme is as follow:

* 1 = The employee prefers this shift
* 2 = The employee dislikes this shift
* 3 = The employee strongly dislikes this shift
* leave blank if the employee cannot make this shift

Notice that bigger number means that the employee dislikes this shift.

Feel free to change the row and column names, or add or delete rows and column to suit your need.

Once you finish, please save the table as a *CSV* file with the name *_employee_preferences.csv_*

## Known Limitations

* Shifts cannot overlap. If you wish to have overlapping shifts, then you must manually add the constraints
