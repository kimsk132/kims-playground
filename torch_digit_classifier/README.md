# Usage:
This project is the neural network that I built to classify the MNIST hand-written digit data. It uses the data from [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/)
To train and generate a model checkpoint, run:
```
python3 train.py
```
To generate the .csv file for submission, run:
```
python3 generate_submission.py
```
